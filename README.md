# Analyzing-Members-Participation-Trend-in-the-edchat-Online-Community-in-R

This project aims at extending our understanding of microblogging-based learning communities by examining members’ participation in the weekly online synchronous chats from 2009 to 2015.

Used SQL to analyze #Edchat DB for evaluating:

• How many participants contributed to in the synchronous online chats hosted by the #edchat community? Is the number of participants increasing or decreasing over the past five years?

• How does the level of participation vary among the contributing members based on the number of tweets generated? Do some members contribute much more than others during a certain period of time?

• How often do new members join the community’s online chatting events? Does that trend stay the same over the past five years?
